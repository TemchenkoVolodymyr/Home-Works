      <p>I thought it might be fun to put together a related piece. This time, detailing my personal aspirations, my
        dreams and the aims I have for my life.

        Knowing someone’s personal goals provides an insight into who they are.

        I figured writing this might help you guys get to know me a bit better. Likewise, it’s always somewhat inspiring
        to learn about someone else’s goals- it’s an encouragement to set goals of your own.

        Hopefully, you might feel in some way inspired by reading about mine.

        Equally, from a selfish perspective, there’s something powerful about writing down the goals in your head. When
        your life’s dreams and goals remain unspoken, it’s all too easy to ‘forget’ they were ever there.

        Telling others about your goals is a crucial step to committing to them.

        With all that said, here you go: my own personal dream list of 37 dreams for the future.</p>
